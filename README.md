# GageCalibrationTracker
Introducing Gage Calibration Tracker, a simple yet sophisticated gage calibration management software solution designed to simplify the task of maintaining tool calibration records. This user-friendly software is seamlessly integrated with Microsoft Excel, offering a highly efficient and free-running experience.

We suggest using version 3.13.3 or higher, as version 3.12.3 resolved a critical issue with the database that could potentially result in data loss and version 3.13.3 fixed an issue with Admin Default Credentials.
